### NFL Betting Spread Prediction

__Interact with this model and view historical performance data for your favorite team <a href="http://promatchpredict.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>__


**Project overview:** As an avid sports fan, I looked for opportunities to incorporate both my fandom and my technical skillsets.

I scraped historical performance data, historical betting spreads, and historical weather to create a dataset to train a random forest classifier, which flows into the website listed above. This was a great project to construct an ETL pipeline, train/test an ML model, and then deploy said model to the cloud so others could interact with it.

The diagram below details how the website is powered and where data comes from

### Is The Powerball Rigged?

**Project overview:** I wanted to see if the powerball lottery was truly a fair lottery. If it wasn't, I would take advantage

The powerball lottery selects 5 random numbers between 1 and 69 without replacement. If the lottery was fair, the distribution of these numbers should match that of random distribution for numbers picked between 1 and 69 without replacement.

Unfortunately, the lottery is indeed a fair game, meaning I won't become a billionaire anytime soon. The QQ plot shows that the two distributions line up nearly perfectly, proving the powerball is indeed selecting the numbers at random, and there isn't any preference towards smaller or larger numbers.
