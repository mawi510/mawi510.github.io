### NFL Betting Spread Prediction

**Project overview:** As an avid sports fan, I looked for opportunities to incorporate both my fandom and my technical skillsets.

I scraped historical performance data, historical betting spreads, and historical weather to create a dataset to train both a gradient boosted regression and a random forest classifier. 

The dataset looked at 3 game rolling averages of various metrics including offensive total yards, defensive turnovers, and opponent strength (measured as total point spread / total games played). What was most surprising was that weather the weather variables had small coefficients. Not surprisingly, the strength of the opponent had the highest coefficient

The gradient boosted regression had a RMSE of ~10, which isn't great, and has a lot of room for improvement. The random forest classifier has a precision of ~70%, and recall of ~59%, meaning the model tends to over-classify which teams will cover the spread.


***Technical skills:*** Multi-Linear Regression, Random Forests
